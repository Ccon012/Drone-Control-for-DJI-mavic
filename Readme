The following is a loose implementation of object detection through a DJI Mavic drone. Upon start of the WeBots controller, the mavic rises in altitude and outputs the location
of color-specified objects on screen. The type of object to check for is determined based upon the 'obj' variable. The obj can be specified as "goal" to locate the green goal
object on screen, "obstacles" to specify the red waypoint identifiaction, or "testing" to specify a certain color value that should be identified in the Taskbar window created by 
OpenCV. The drone will eventually crash after identifying objects, this is normal consiudering there was not enough time to impliment automated movement control.
Manual control can be used by the specified instructions given in the console output, however it is buggy.
